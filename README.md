# ‚úàÔ∏è Route Records Project (C)

A data-processing program written in C that reads and manages airline route data from a CSV file.  
The program allows users to search, summarize, and analyze passenger traffic between airports and airlines.

## üß† Overview

The Route Records project processes a dataset of flight routes and passenger counts over several months.  
It supports menu-based searches by:
- Route (origin ‚Üí destination)
- Origin airport
- Destination airport
- Airline code  

The program aggregates passenger data, calculates totals, and outputs statistics for matched routes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **File Input (`data.csv`):**  
  Reads monthly route data (month, origin, destination, airline, passengers).  

- **Dynamic Allocation:**  
  Uses `malloc()` to create a dynamic array of `RouteRecord` structures.  

- **Struct-Based Design:**  
  Each record stores:
  ```c
  typedef struct {
      char originAirportCode[4];
      char destinationAirportcode[4];
      char airlineCode[3];
      int passengerCount[6];
  } RouteRecord;
